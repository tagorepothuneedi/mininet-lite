Mininet Lite

- This is a side project for my research. Goal is to minimalize the mininet-wifi by Prof Ramon to a simplistic simulator which can create wireless mesh topologies. 
- This model contains only the required tools for mesh networks .No mobility/IoT/VADHOC Networks tools are present.
- Usage is quite similar to mininet-wifi.please refer main repository for information
